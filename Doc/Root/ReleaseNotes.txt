1. INTRODUCTION

	About SharePoint Learning Kit

SharePoint Learning Kit (SLK) is a SCORM 2004-conformant e-learning delivery and tracking application built as a SharePoint solution. It works with all versions of SharePoint 2007 and SharePoint 2010:

* Supports SCORM 1.2, SCORM 2004, and Class Server content, allowing users to store and manage this content in SharePoint document libraries.
* Supports a learner-centric or instructor-led (assigned) workflow.
* Allows assignment, tracking and grading of both e-learning and non-e-learning content.

SharePoint Learning Kit is a community source project. This means that it is made available to you for free, and that you can use it as-is or modify it to suit your needs as long as you comply with the conditions that are described in the accompanying License.txt file. You are responsible for reading and complying with this license. SharePoint Learning Kit is supported by a community of users and developers through discussion forums at http://www.codeplex.com/slk. You are invited to participate in this community, to help others, to report issues, and to contribute your ideas to carry SLK forward. For the most up to date information about SLK, please refer to http://www.codeplex.com/slk.

2.  NEW IN THIS RELEASE

Feature: SharePoint Learning Kit Content Types
    There are new content types which add options to the edit control block without having to enable features which add the options to all documents. These allow you more granular control.

Feature:    Enhanced Self Assignment Functionality
    You can now start an assignment immediately when self-assigning rather than going to the lobby page first. This is either by one of the new content types or via a new web part which displays documents as links to starting them.

Feature:    stsadm commands
    slkadm is now deprecated and it's functionality has been moved into a set of stsadm commands. Powershell commands have not been implemented yet due to supporting SharePoint 2007 and 2010.

Feature:    Configurable at Web Application level
    SLK is now configurable at the web application level as well as the site collection level.

4.  HOW YOU CAN PARTICIPATE

The SharePoint Learning Kit is a community-owned project. All of us on the product development team believe strongly in the power of e-learning, and we believe that SLK is a great e-learning component that will be useful for a wide variety of instructional scenarios. We expect and hope that SLK will continue to grow and improve over time, but it can only do so with your help.

A community is only as strong as its members. Community members will find and fix issues, help each other learn best practices, contribute ideas, and determine the SLK roadmap. Going forward, SLK will be a reflection of the energy, drive and creativity of its community.

If, like us, you believe in SLK, then we invite you to join us. Contribute your ideas, help others who are learning SLK, and help carry SLK forward by joining the community at http://www.codeplex.com/slk.

Thank you for your interest in and support of the SharePoint Learning Kit.
