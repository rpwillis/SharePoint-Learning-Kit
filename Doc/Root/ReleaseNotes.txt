* Supports SCORM 1.2, SCORM 2004, and Class Server content, allowing users to store and manage this content in SharePoint document libraries.
* Supports a learner-centric or instructor-led (assigned) workflow.
* Allows assignment, tracking and grading of both e-learning and non-e-learning content.

HOW YOU CAN PARTICIPATE

The SharePoint Learning Kit is a community-owned project. All of us on the product development team believe strongly in the power of e-learning, and we believe that SLK is a great e-learning component that will be useful for a wide variety of instructional scenarios. We expect and hope that SLK will continue to grow and improve over time, but it can only do so with your help.

A community is only as strong as its members. Community members will find and fix issues, help each other learn best practices, contribute ideas, and determine the SLK roadmap. Going forward, SLK will be a reflection of the energy, drive and creativity of its community.

If, like us, you believe in SLK, then we invite you to join us. Contribute your ideas, help others who are learning SLK, and help carry SLK forward by joining the community at http://www.codeplex.com/slk.
