INTRODUCTION

	About SharePoint Learning Kit

SharePoint Learning Kit (SLK) is a SCORM 2004-conformant e-learning delivery and tracking application built as a Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 solution. It works with either Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 or Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007, and has the following core features:

* Supports SCORM 1.2, SCORM 2004, and Class Server content, allowing users to store and manage this content in SharePoint document libraries.
* Supports a learner-centric or instructor-led (assigned) workflow.
* Allows assignment, tracking and grading of both e-learning and non-e-learning content.

SharePoint Learning Kit is a community source project. This means that it is made available to you for free, and that you can use it as-is or modify it to suit your needs as long as you comply with the conditions that are described in the accompanying License.txt file. You are responsible for reading and complying with this license. SharePoint Learning Kit is supported by a community of users and developers through discussion forums at http://www.codeplex.com/slk. You are invited to participate in this community, to help others, to report issues, and to contribute your ideas to carry SLK forward. For the most up to date information about SLK, please refer to http://www.codeplex.com/slk.

	About This Drop

This release of SLK is organized in three zip packages:

SLK-Install-1.0.[build]-ENU.zip -- contains all files necessary to install and run SLK on a Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 or Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 server. You do not need to be a developer to use this package. See GettingStarted.pdf at the root of this package for installation instructions.

SLK-SDK-1.0.[build]-ENU.zip -- contains documentation and sample code for the SLK/MLC API, as well as the compiled binaries for the MLC and SLK functionality. MLC is the underlying e-learning engine on which SLK is built, and it also can be re-used, integrated into other products, and redistributed under the terms of the accompanying License.txt file. This package is for developers who are considering building e-learning application functionality using MLC, or extending SLK by writing complementary application code such as new Web Parts, tools, etc. See Documentation.htm at the root of this package.

SLK-SourceCode-1.0.[build]-ENU.zip -- contains the source code for MLC and SLK, and the functional specifications for SLK. It is for developers who are interested in extending core MLC or SLK functionality, or who want to understand more about how MLC and SLK work. After reading Documentation.htm in the SLK-SDK-1.0.[build]-ENU.zip package, see the SLK Core Concepts specification in the Specifications folder of this package to get started. Source code for MLC and SLK is also posted on CodePlex, and you can build SLK directly from CodePlex. See http://www.codeplex.com/slk for more information.


SLK KNOWN ISSUES

***NOTE: The SLK schema has changed in this release. You will need to delete your database and re-configure SLK when upgrading***

Numbers in square brackets are issue tracking numbers for future reference.

	SCORM Conformance	

SCORM 2004: SLK has passed conformance certification for SCORM 2004, 2nd Edition.

SCORM 1.2: The SLK team has run the SCORM 1.2 certification suite and we believe that SLK and its underlying MLC components are conformant with SCORM 1.2 with the following exceptions:

[1305] SLK does not provide a mechanism to specify whether content is to be taken for “credit” or “no credit”.

[1330] It is possible for content to specify a value of “not attempted” on cmi.core.lesson_status. This is prohibited in SCORM 1.2, however since content is prohibited from setting this value, this issue will not affect conformant content.

[1347] When content sets a value on cmi.comments, the new value overwrites any existing value. SCORM 1.2 specifies that it should concatenate.

[861] In questions of type ‘sequencing’, setting student_response or correct_response returns an error.

	Large Content Packages

By default, SharePoint has a 50MB upload limit for document libraries. If you use large content packages, you will have to increase this limit in SharePoint Central Administration.

[1377] SharePoint Learning Kit must extract content from SharePoint and unpackage it to a cache folder prior to transmission to the viewer. Caching happens when a user selects “E-Learning Actions,” or when content that hasn’t been accessed recently is accessed again. In some cases, very large content packages can take a long time to cache, resulting in delays and possible browser timeouts while caching. If you use very large content packages, you may need to increase the IIS connection timeout.

[1377] Generally SharePoint Learning Kit streams content from SharePoint into the cache, however if content was assigned to a learner and subsequently modified, SharePoint Learning Kit must retrieve the earlier version when the learner assignment is accessed. In this case, SharePoint Learning Kit must copy the entire file into memory before writing it to the cache. With large files, this can cause performance problems. We therefore recommend that if you assign multiple versions of large packages, you not rely on SharePoint versioning to maintain the various versions, but instead store multiple versions as separate files in the document library.

	Class Server Content

[1391] The Class Server SDK ships with a piece of sample content demonstrating how Flash content can communicate with hidden form fields in the Class Server HTML. This sample relies on an internal naming convention used by Class Server that is undocumented and unsupported in SLK. To achieve the kind of Flash reporting demonstrated in this sample, we recommend using SCORM rather than Class Server content.

	SLK UI

[1121] When an instructor has assigned content to a site and subsequently has permissions on that site revoked, the instructor can still access the assignment via the Assignment List Web Part, however if the assignment properties are edited, the potential instructors and learners for the assignment will not reflect the site to which the assignment is assigned. Instead, it will reflect the site from which the assignment was accessed.

[1133] In cases where a learner has not yet submitted an assignment comprised of Class Server content, instructor review of the assignment may show pages that the learner has not yet completed without correct answers. Once the assignment has been submitted or collected, then all pages will render correctly for the instructor.

[1312] If you add domain users to a local machine group, and then add that machine group to SharePoint as an instructor or learner, then the domain users will not appear in the assignment creation or editing UI when the machine group is enumerated.

	Configuration

[1156] If SQL Server times out during configuration, the SLK database may be in a state that will prevent configuration from succeeding on subsequent attempts. Typically this will result in an “Invalid object name ‘Configuration’” error message. In this case, delete the SharePoint Learning Kit database and re-configure.

	Developer Issues

[1016] Slk\Samples\AddInstructors\AddInstructors.aspx.cs: Lines 80 and 136 call SPControl.GetContextWeb() in the context of using statements. This causes the spWeb to be disposed when the using block is exited. This is wrong. Objects that are obtained from SPControl.GetContextWeb() should not be disposed.

[1324, 1325] If a LearningSession has not been started, LearningSession.ShowExit returns False even though it is possible to exit a LearningSession that has not been started. In addition, in cases where the session cannot be exited, the error message does not reflect the fact that a LearningSession that has not been started can be exited.


HOW YOU CAN PARTICIPATE

With this release, the SharePoint Learning Kit project has officially been turned over to the community. All of us on the product development team believe strongly in the power of e-learning, and we believe that SLK is a great e-learning component that will be useful for a wide variety of instructional scenarios. We expect and hope that SLK will continue to grow and improve over time, but it can only do so with your help.

A community is only as strong as its members. Community members will find and fix issues, help each other learn best practices, contribute ideas, and determine the SLK roadmap. Going forward, SLK will be a reflection of the energy, drive and creativity of its community.

If, like us, you believe in SLK, then we invite you to join us. Contribute your ideas, help others who are learning SLK, and help carry SLK forward by joining the community at http://www.codeplex.com/slk.

Thank you for your interest in and support of the SharePoint Learning Kit.
