SharePoint Learning Kit LanguagePacks Version 1.0 Install Instructions
Last Updated:	06/15/2006

The language packs are packaged as SharePoint solutions. The language pack comes with several command files to assist you in adding and deploying this solution. These command files assume that your install location for SharePoint is the c: drive, and that http://localhost is accessible for the stsadm command. If this is not the case, edit the language pack command files to change the install drive, and replace 'localhost' with the fully-qualified domain name of your server or server farm.

Add and deploy the language pack as follows:
1. Copy the contents from the specific language pack from the SLK drop to your install drive. The rest of this example assumes you've copied it to c:\Install
2. Click Start->Run
3. Type 'cmd', and then click OK
4. Type 'cd \Install', Enter
5. Type 'AddSolution', Enter
6. Type 'DeploySolution', Enter. Note that SharePoint solution deployment is asynchronous, so the solution may not be deployed immediately.
7. To verify that the solution deployed successfully, type 'EnumSolutions', Enter. You should see a block of XML <LanguagePack Locale="<your locale>"> within <Solution Name=”sharepointlearningkit.wsp”> containing <LastOperationResult>DeploymentSucceeded</LastOperationResult>. If deployment is still pending, wait a minute or so and try EnumSolutions again.
Note: If deployment fails, you can often determine the cause by reviewing the latest .log file in the WSS LOGS directory (typically "C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\web server extensions\12\LOGS"). Regardless of the reason, you must cancel the deployment job before you can try again. To cancel a deployment job, go to SharePoint Central Administration, Operations, Timer Job Definitions, click on the deployment job, and click "Delete".
