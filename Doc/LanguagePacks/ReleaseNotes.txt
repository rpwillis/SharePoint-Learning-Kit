INTRODUCTION

	About the language packs

	This drop contains language packs which when added-on to an SLK installation will enable its use in the local language. The language packs are packaged as SharePoint solutions and can be deployed in the same way as SLK. Refer to InstallInstructions.txt for detailed installation instructions.
	This release contains a total of 29 language packs that have been developed by the community. The release has been built out of the changeset numbered 33316 (http://www.codeplex.com/SLK/SourceControl/DirectoryView.aspx?SourcePath=&changeSetId=33316). 


VERSIONING INFORMATION

	The 1.1 language packs should be installed with SLK 1.3.1 and any SLK versions that follow until the release of the next version of language packs. They infact work with all SLK binaries that are built out of change sets following the 29530 change set. Please note that 1.1 language packs will not function with any SLK versions prior to 1.3.1.

QUALITY OF THE LANGUAGE PACKS

 	The percentage of messages (or strings) that are translated into the local language is a good indicator (though, not the best) of the quality of the language pack. Below is a list compiled using the PercentageCalculator tool available here, http://www.codeplex.com/Project/Download/FileDownload.aspx?ProjectName=SLK&DownloadId=16342.

*en-GB being an english translation, only 5% of the original strings needed translation. This does not indicate that the translation is bad.
