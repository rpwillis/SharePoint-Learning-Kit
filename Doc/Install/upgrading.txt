Upgrade to 1.7 from 1.6

    To upgrade from 1.6 you need to: 
        a.  Retract the SharePoint Learning Kit solution
        b.  Once retraction has finished then remove the solution
        c.  Then add solution as in installing SLK and then deploy it to the appropriate web applications

    There are no database changes required.

Upgrade to 1.7 from 1.5 or earlier
    Upgrade as per 1.7 to 1.6, then run the database upgrade script upgrade16.sql on all your SLK databases. Make sure that you back them up first.
